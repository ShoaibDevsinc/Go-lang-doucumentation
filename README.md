# GO Programming Language:
## Intoduction:
The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
## Features:
1. Go always includes the binary in builds.
2. Go has no centrally hosted service for program dependencies.
3. Go is call-by-value.
4. The ‘defer’ keyword.
5. Go adopts the best features of functional programming.
6. Go has implicit interfaces.
7. Error handling.
8. Concurrency.
9. The Go Standard Library.
10. Debugging: the Go Playground.
